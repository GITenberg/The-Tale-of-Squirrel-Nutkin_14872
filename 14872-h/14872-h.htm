<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/8.jpg"><img src="./images/8-tb.jpg" alt="Nutkin and his tail" title="Nutkin and his tail" /></a></p>


<p>This is a Tale about a tail&mdash;a tail that belonged to a little red
squirrel, and his name was Nutkin.</p>

<p>He had a brother called Twinkleberry, and a great many cousins: they lived
in a wood at the edge of a lake.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/11.jpg"><img src="./images/11-tb.jpg" alt="Old Brown Flying Home" title="Old Brown Flying Home" /></a></p>


<p>In the middle of the lake there is an island covered with trees and nut
bushes; and amongst those trees stands a hollow oak-tree, which is the
house of an owl who is called Old Brown.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/12.jpg"><img src="./images/12-tb.jpg" alt="At the Edge of the Lake" title="At the Edge of the Lake" /></a></p>

<p>One autumn when the nuts were ripe, and the leaves on the hazel bushes
were golden and green&mdash;Nutkin and Twinkleberry and all the other little
squirrels came out of the wood, and down to the edge of the lake.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/15.jpg"><img src="./images/15-tb.jpg" alt="Rafting to the Island" title="Rafting to the Island" /></a></p>

<p>They made little rafts out of twigs, and they paddled away over the water
to Owl Island to gather nuts.</p>

<p>Each squirrel had a little sack and a large oar, and spread out his tail
for a sail.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/16.jpg"><img src="./images/16-tb.jpg" alt="The First Offering" title="The First Offering" /></a></p>


<p>They also took with them an offering of three fat mice as a present for
Old Brown, and put them down upon his door-step.</p>

<p>Then Twinkleberry and the other little squirrels each made a low bow, and
said politely&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;Old Mr. Brown, will you favour us with permission to gather nuts upon
your island?&quot;</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/19.jpg"><img src="./images/19-tb.jpg" alt="Nutkin Bobbing Like a Cherry" title="Nutkin Bobbing Like a Cherry" /></a></p>

<p>But Nutkin was excessively impertinent in his manners. He bobbed up and
down like a little red <i>cherry</i>, singing&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;Riddle me, riddle me, rot-tot-tote!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">A little wee man, in a red red coat!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">A staff in his hand, and a stone in his throat;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">If you'll tell me this riddle, I'll give you a groat.&quot;</span><br />
</p>

<p>Now this riddle is as old as the hills; Mr. Brown paid no attention
whatever to Nutkin.</p>

<p>He shut his eyes obstinately and went to sleep.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/20.jpg"><img src="./images/20-tb.jpg" alt="Filling the Sacks" title="Filling the Sacks" /></a></p>


<p>The squirrels filled their little sacks with nuts, and sailed away home in
the evening.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/23.jpg"><img src="./images/23-tb.jpg" alt="The Second Offering" title="The Second Offering" /></a></p>


<p>But next morning they all came back again to Owl Island; and Twinkleberry
and the others brought a fine fat mole, and laid it on the stone in front
of Old Brown's doorway, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;Mr. Brown, will you favour us with your gracious permission to gather
some more nuts?&quot;</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/24.jpg"><img src="./images/24-tb.jpg" alt="Tickling with a Nettle" title="Tickling with a Nettle" /></a></p>


<p>But Nutkin, who had no respect, began to dance up and down, tickling old
Mr. Brown with a <i>nettle</i> and singing&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;Old Mr. B! Riddle-me-ree!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Hitty Pitty within the wall,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Hitty Pitty without the wall;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">If you touch Hitty Pitty,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Hitty Pitty will bite you!&quot;</span><br />
</p>

<p>Mr. Brown woke up suddenly and carried the mole into his house.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/27.jpg"><img src="./images/27-tb.jpg" alt="Shut the Door in His Face" title="Shut the Door in His Face" /></a></p>


<p>He shut the door in Nutkin's face. Presently a little thread of blue
<i>smoke</i> from a wood fire came up from the top of the tree, and Nutkin
peeped through the key-hole and sang&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;A house full, a hole full!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">And you cannot gather a bowl-full!&quot;</span><br />
</p>



<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/28.jpg"><img src="./images/28-tb.jpg" alt="Playing Marbles" title="Playing Marbles" /></a></p>


<p>The squirrels searched for nuts all over the island and filled their
little sacks.</p>

<p>But Nutkin gathered oak-apples&mdash;yellow and scarlet&mdash;and sat upon a
beech-stump playing marbles, and watching the door of old Mr. Brown.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/31.jpg"><img src="./images/31-tb.jpg" alt="Fishing for Minnows" title="Fishing for Minnows" /></a></p>


<p>On the third day the squirrels got up very early and went fishing; they
caught seven fat minnows as a present for Old Brown.</p>

<p>They paddled over the lake and landed under a crooked chestnut tree on Owl
Island.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/32.jpg"><img src="./images/32-tb.jpg" alt="Bringing the Third Offering" title="Bringing the Third Offering" /></a></p>

<p>Twinkleberry and six other little squirrels each carried a fat minnow; but
Nutkin, who had no nice manners, brought no present at all. He ran in
front, singing&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;The man in the wilderness said to me,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">'How many strawberries grow in the sea?'</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">I answered him as I thought good&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">'As many red herrings as grow in the wood.'&quot;</span><br />
</p>

<p>But old Mr. Brown took no interest in riddles&mdash;not even when the answer
was provided for him.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/35.jpg"><img src="./images/35-tb.jpg" alt="The Fourth Offering" title="The Fourth Offering" /></a></p>


<p>On the fourth day the squirrels brought a present of six fat beetles,
which were as good as plums in <i>plum-pudding</i> for Old Brown. Each beetle
was wrapped up carefully in a dock-leaf, fastened with a pine-needle pin.</p>

<p>But Nutkin sang as rudely as ever&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">&quot;Old Mr. B! riddle-me-ree</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Flour of England, fruit of Spain,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Met together in a shower of rain;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">Put in a bag tied round with a string,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">If you'll tell me this riddle, I'll give you a ring!&quot;</span><br />
</p>


<p>Which was ridiculous of Nutkin, because he had not got any ring to give to
Old Brown.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/36.jpg"><img src="./images/36-tb.jpg" alt="Playing with Pincushions" title="Playing with Pincushions" /></a></p>


<p>The other squirrels hunted up and down the nut bushes; but Nutkin
gathered robin's pincushions off a briar bush, and stuck them full of
pine-needle pins.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/39.jpg"><img src="./images/39-tb.jpg" alt="The Fifth Offering" title="The Fifth Offering" /></a></p>

<p>On the fifth day the squirrels brought a present of wild honey; it was so
sweet and sticky that they licked their fingers as they put it down upon
the stone. They had stolen it out of a bumble <i>bees'</i> nest on the tippitty
top of the hill.</p>

<p>But Nutkin skipped up and down, singing&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;Hum-a-bum! buzz! buzz! Hum-a-bum buzz!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">As I went over Tipple-tine</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">I met a flock of bonny swine;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Some yellow-nacked, some yellow backed!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">They were the very bonniest swine</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">That e'er went over Tipple-tine.&quot;</span><br />
</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/40.jpg"><img src="./images/40-tb.jpg" alt="Eating the Honey" title="Eating the Honey" /></a></p>


<p>Old Mr. Brown turned up his eyes in disgust at the impertinence of Nutkin.</p>

<p>But he ate up the honey!</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/43.jpg"><img src="./images/43-tb.jpg" alt="Playing Ninepins" title="Playing Ninepins" /></a></p>

<p>The squirrels filled their little sacks with nuts.</p>

<p>But Nutkin sat upon a big flat rock, and played ninepins with a crab apple
and green fir-cones.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/44.jpg"><img src="./images/44-tb.jpg" alt="The Sixth Offering" title="The Sixth Offering" /></a></p>


<p>On the sixth day, which was Saturday, the squirrels came again for the
last time; they brought a new-laid <i>egg</i> in a little rush basket as a last
parting present for Old Brown.</p>

<p>But Nutkin ran in front laughing, and shouting&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;Humpty Dumpty lies in the beck,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">With a white counterpane round his neck,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Forty doctors and forty wrights,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Cannot put Humpty Dumpty to rights!&quot;</span><br />
</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/47.jpg"><img src="./images/47-tb.jpg" alt="Old Brown's Interest" title="Old Brown's Interest" /></a></p>

<p>Now old Mr. Brown took an interest in eggs; he opened one eye and shut it
again. But still he did not speak.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/48.jpg"><img src="./images/48-tb.jpg" alt="More and More Impertinent" title="More and More Impertinent" /></a></p>


<p>Nutkin became more and more impertinent&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">&quot;Old Mr. B! Old Mr. B!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Hickamore, Hackamore, on the King's kitchen door;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">All the King's horses, and all the King's men,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Couldn't drive Hickamore, Hackamore,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Off the King's kitchen door.&quot;</span><br />
</p>

<p>Nutkin danced up and down like a <i>sunbeam</i>; but still Old Brown said
nothing at all.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/51.jpg"><img src="./images/51-tb.jpg" alt="Leaping at Old Brown's Head" title="Leaping at Old Brown's Head" /></a></p>


<p>Nutkin began again&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">&quot;Arthur O'Bower has broken his band,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">He comes roaring up the land!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">The King of Scots with all his power,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Cannot turn Arthur of the Bower!&quot;</span><br />
</p>

<p>Nutkin made a whirring noise to sound like the <i>wind</i>, and he took a
running jump right onto the head of Old Brown!...</p>

<p>Then all at once there was a flutterment and a scufflement and a loud
&quot;Squeak!&quot;</p>

<p>The other squirrels scuttered away into the bushes.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/52.jpg"><img src="./images/52-tb.jpg" alt="Peeping Cautiously" title="Peeping Cautiously" /></a></p>


<p>When they came back very cautiously, peeping round the tree&mdash;there was Old
Brown sitting on his door-step, quite still, with his eyes closed, as if
nothing had happened.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p><i>But Nutkin was in his waistcoat pocket!</i></p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/55.jpg"><img src="./images/55-tb.jpg" alt="Pinned Nutkin" title="Pinned Nutkin" /></a></p>


<p>This looks like the end of the story; but it isn't.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/57.jpg"><img src="./images/57-tb.jpg" alt="Escape" title="Escape" /></a></p>

<p>Old Brown carried Nutkin into his house, and held him up by the tail,
intending to skin him; but Nutkin pulled so very hard that his tail broke
in two, and he dashed up the staircase and escaped out of the attic
window.</p>

<p class="figcenter"><a href="./images/58.jpg"><img src="./images/58-tb.jpg" alt="Nutkin Without His Tail" title="Nutkin Without His Tail" /></a></p>

<p>And to this day, if you meet Nutkin up a tree and ask him a riddle, he
will throw sticks at you, and stamp his feet and scold, and shout&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;Cuck-cuck-cuck-cur-r-r-cuck-k-k!&quot;</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
