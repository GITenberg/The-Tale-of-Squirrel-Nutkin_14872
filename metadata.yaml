description: "The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin is a children's book written and illustrated\
  \ by Beatrix Potter and first published by Frederick Warne & Co. in August 1903.\
  \ The story is about an impertinent red squirrel named Nutkin and his narrow escape\
  \ from an owl called Old Brown. The book followed Potter's hugely successful The\
  \ Tale of Peter Rabbit, and was an instant hit. The now familiar endpapers of the\
  \ Peter Rabbit series were introduced in the book.\nSquirrel Nutkin had its origins\
  \ in a story and picture letter Potter sent Norah Moore, the daughter of her former\
  \ governess, Annie Carter Moore. The background illustrations were modelled on Derwentwater\
  \ and St. Herbert's Island in the Lake District.\nOne commentator has likened Squirrel\
  \ Nutkin's impertinent behaviour to that of the rebellious working-class of Potter's\
  \ own day, and another commentator has noted the tale's similarities to pourquoi\
  \ tales and folk tales in its explanations of Squirrel Nutkin's short tail and characteristics\
  \ of squirrel behaviour. An abbreviated version of the tale appeared as a segment\
  \ in the 1971 ballet film, The Tales of Beatrix Potter.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
